Background
==========

* There is a considerable demand for exchanging coins
* This is mostly done on cryptocurrency exchanges
* An exchange is a **honeypot** and hacks are common
* Some exchanges are now **decentralised**

In a truly decentralised exchange the exchange should not hold any user funds: The transaction should be solely between users

The atomic swap is an important concept

Atomic swaps need timeout mechanisms to replace trust

timeouts
========

A timeout on a transaction implies that it can not be transmitted before the time limit
A timeout on a UTXO implies that it can not be spent before the time limit


CLTV is OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY

See Handout and Example for more detail
Examples
--------

Example of use (from `here <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Freezing_funds_until_a_time_in_the_future>`_)

Using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY it is possible to make funds provably unspendable until a certain point in the future.


::

  scriptPubKey: <expiry time> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP 
                OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY 
                OP_CHECKSIG

  scriptSig: <sig> <pubKey>

Handout
-------

There are several timeout features in the Bitcoin protocol, implemented as operators in Bitcoin's scrypt language. 

Here we will consider OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, implemented as `BIP: 65 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki>`_.

This description of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, or CLTV is taken mostly from the `Bitcoin wiki <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script>`_ and the initial CLTV proposal as an improvement to the Bitcoin protocol `BIP: 65 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki>`_.

CLTV marks a transaction as invalid if the top stack item is greater than the transaction's nLockTime field, otherwise script evaluation continues as though an OP_NOP was executed. Transaction is also invalid if 

1. the stack is empty; or 

2. the top stack item is negative; or 

3. the top stack item is greater than or equal to 500000000 while the transaction's nLockTime field is less than 500000000, or vice versa; or 

4. the input's nSequence field is equal to 0xffffffff. The precise semantics are described in BIP 0065.

more detail to come...

::

  A picks a random number x
  A creates TX1: "Pay w BTC to <B's public key> if (x for H(x) known and signed by B) or (signed by A and B)"
  A creates TX2: "Pay w BTC from TX1 to <A's public key>, locked 48 hours in the future, signed by A"
  A sends TX2 to B 
  B signs TX2 and returns to A

  1) A submits TX1 to the network

  B creates TX3: "Pay v alt-coins to <A-public-key> if (x for H(x) known and signed by A) or (signed by A and B)"
  B creates TX4: "Pay v alt-coins from TX3 to <B's public key>, locked 24 hours in the future, signed by B"
  B sends TX4 to A
  A signs TX4 and sends back to B

  2) B submits TX3 to the network
  3) A spends TX3 giving x
  4) B spends TX1 using x

This is atomic (with timeout). If the process is halted, it can be reversed no matter when it
is stopped.

::

  Before 1: Nothing public has been broadcast, so nothing happens 
  Between 1 and 2: A can use refund transaction after 48 hours to get his money back 
  Between 2 and 3: B can get refund after 24 hours. A has 24 more hours to get his refund 
  After 3: Transaction can be completed by each of the 2 parties

::

   - A must spend his new coin within 24 hours or B can claim the refund and keep his coins 
   - B must spend his new coin within 48 hours or A can claim the refund and keep his coins

For safety, both should complete the process with lots of time until the deadlines.

Alternatives
============

Several decentralised exchanges (DEXs) exist, but the definition of a DEX is not clear

Examples:

Barterdex: https://komodoplatform.com/decentralized-exchange/

Bit Square (bisq): https://bisq.network/

etc

The missing link: Information flow
==================================

Recall the process:

* A creates TX1: "Pay w BTC to <B's public key> if (x for H(x) known and signed by B) or (signed by A and B)"
* B creates TX3: "Pay v alt-coins to <A-public-key> if (x for H(x) known and signed by A) or (signed by A and B)"

So **before any exchange is set up**,

* A needs to know that B wants to buy w BTC
* B needs to know that A will sell for v alt-coins


Then, to be able to **start the exchange**

* A needs to know B's BTC public key 
* B needs to know A's alt-coin public key

This information exchange needs to be done outside the transactions, as an MoU or "announcement(s) of intent".
The info exchange does NOT need to be binding!
The info exchange should cost something to avoid spam.

**During the exchange** the parties need to communicate:

* A sends TX2 to B
* B signs TX2 and returns to A
* B sends TX4 to A
* A signs TX4 and sends back to B

**The entire process needs to be without trust and without knowing who the other party is**

Announcing the atomic swap
==========================

* Use a forum (telegram etc)?
* Use a specialised channel (BarterDex/Bisq)?
* Use an existing coin (mempool)?

* Alice should in principle be able to use the Smileycoin blockchain to announce 

 - ``SELL 1000 SMLY for 1 LTC``

* and Bob could accept the offer  by responding

 - ``ACCEPT offer TxId```

* etc.

Could be done through modifications of smileycoin-qt

A draft proposal: https://tutor-web.info/news-1/announcing-intent-cross-chain-atomic-swap/

Dedicated wallets? https://atomicwallet.io/  (or scam?)
