Automating access to cryptocurrency exchanges
=============================================

Most cryptocurrency exchanges allow some sort of programmed access.

This is usually called an application programming interface or API and is normally done through a browser-style access (URL or URI). 

For the user this implies that it is possible to write programs to monitor prices or even automate buying and selling in different markets.

The programs can in principle be written in any programming language, but language support for HTML varies quite a bit.
