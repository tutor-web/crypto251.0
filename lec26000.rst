Doing stuff on the blockchain
=============================

The blockchain can be used for a lot more than transactions:

* Sending data, using the data fields
* Coding data into the amounts
* Monitoring transactions
* Executing code as a response to transactions



..

So how do you do stuff?
=======================

Method 1: the config file...

option to monitor incoming transactions:

``walletnotify=/home/user/bin/command %s``

code everything into the transactions

Benefits: No changes to the wallets

Method 2: Change the wallet, add wallet commands

Benefits: No changes to the protocol

Method 3: Change the protocol

Gambling on the blockchain
==========================

**basics...**

``sendtoaddress BCJW4iZw7PechFHgtqqSdHmymjnFA6LjNJ 10``

etc

vanity address: Betzy...

``sendtoaddress BEtZyyYqDXqmRJJ45nnL15cuASfiXg9Yik 10``

... needs to be written up

Messages on the blockchain
==========================

See github thread sendwithmessage for Smileycoin

Can send messages by coding it into the blockchain

``smileycoin-cli sendwithmessage BEtZyyYqDXqmRJJ45nnL15cuASfiXg9Yik 1000 "Hello, Betzyy"``

See transaction ``daf75d1ae31877b51856b4dee931600a5a5db819f52a5d98627f8a070a72b723``:

Note how the coding uses ASCII characters 32-128 (0x20-0x7F), requiring 2 bytes per character, see http://www.asciitable.com/ (subtracting 32 dec from each ASCII code)

A very simple ATM on the blockchain
===================================

An Automatic Teller Machine, ATM, dispenses money when you put in a credit card.

An ATM could also dispense Euro when you put in USD.

A blockchain ATM could dispense SMLY when you put in LTC.

For this you need to use two chains, the LTC and SMLY chains. 

* To "put in LTC" means to send LTC to an address. 
* To "dispense SMLY" means to send SMLY to a SMLY address.

For this to work (1) the ATM needs to have a LTC address and (2) the ATM needs to be told about a SMLY address.

This can be done by sending a SMLY address encoded in a LTC transaction.

Traditional data
================

Normal use is through the op return

usually limited to 80 characters, but see

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/78572/op-return-max-bytes-clarification

and example belowExamples
--------


Example of the use of the data field in a SmileyCoin transaction:

::

  createrawtransaction 
    '[{"txid":"b99f638e3a2763f55dba9515382ba6a9f23f6789989660bb893047430c335105",
       "vout":0}]' 
    '{"BQLegZNT2hid77hNXgyFK1vZJ1BU2AvcdV":9,
      "data":"31313131"}'

The reader should try to generate several such transactions to see exactly what changes in the hex code by 
including strings of different lengths.
