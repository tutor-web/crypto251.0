Cryptography use by cryptocurrencies
====================================

Cryptocurrencies use cryptography for several tasks, including:

* signing transactions using a private key
* verifying ownership of an amount to be spent using a public key
* summarising a transaction into a hash
* summaring all transactions in a block into a hash
* summarising a block into a hash
* defining criteria for a block hash to satisfy for a block to be acceptable
